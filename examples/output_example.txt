SQL:
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('week', order_date) AS week,
  SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS aov
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

Explanation:
- Assumes an orders table with order_date, amount, order_id
- Filters to the last quarter
- Aggregates weekly
- Outputs a SQL template only (not executed)
